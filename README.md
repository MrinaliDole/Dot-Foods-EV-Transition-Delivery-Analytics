# Dot-Foods-EV-Transition-Delivery-Analytics

📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates the financial and operational viability of transitioning part of Dot Foods’ fleet to electric-powered trailers. Using more than 260,000 delivery records from 2023, I simulated real-world trailer usage, compared performance of regular vs. electric trailers, and modeled potential cost savings, efficiency gains, and sustainability impact.

📝 Project Summary

We evaluated the financial and operational viability of transitioning Dot Foods’ fleet to electric-powered trailers using over 260,000 2023 delivery records. By cleaning and joining inbound, outbound, and transfer datasets in Python, we identified that 55% of deliveries fell within the optimal EV range (≤180 miles, ≤39K lbs). We then modeled and compared fuel efficiencies of regular vs. smart trailers using hypothesis testing, and built cost models in Python and Excel to estimate per-trip savings of $33–$85 and annual savings of $18M–$23M. Finally, proposed a phased transition plan (4 phases, 1,150 trucks) with infrastructure considerations. The results showed that Dot could achieve 28% fuel cost savings per trip, break even within 7–10 years, and dramatically reduce their carbon footprint—aligning profitability with sustainability goals.
